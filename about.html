            <p>
              A former art student who pursued various 
              disciplines including fashion design, 
              graphic design, fine arts and illustration, 
              I have always been passionate about creating 
              meaningful experiences. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently a undergraduate research assistant
              working on ergonomic research, user friendly
              product development, and UXUI design at 
              The University of Michigan where I am pursuing a degree
              in computer science. I am exploring a blend of these
              two passions through my experience in the website team of
              the Korean International Student Association. Here, I
              contributed to developing a fully responsive, production
              level website by implementing CRUD applications with various 
              industry skills including an AWS backend and Next.js frontend. 
              Currently my team is working on converting the website to 
              React Native to deploy a mobile application version. 

              These opportunities have allowed me to explore my different
              yet synonymous passions in art and technology.
